# To Do

1.  clean up web app
- Rename repo:  (food-classifier to ----> mobile-deep-learning-classifier)
- Rename deployed heroku url (food-classifier to ----> mobile-deep-learning-classifier)
- This is a good example:  
  - the form request example is here: https://github.com/nikhilno1/healthy-or-not
  - app: https://healthy-or-not.herokuapp.com

#### example web apps
- [healthy or not app](https://healthy-or-not.herokuapp.com)
  - code:  https://github.com/nikhilno1/healthy-or-not/blob/master/food-detector.py
- [water classifier heroku app](https://water-classifier1.herokuapp.com)
- [water classifier code](https://github.com/shankarj67/Water-classifier-fastai)

https://id.heroku.com/login

Also, need to format output, or at least change to 2 decimal places.

2. figure out which repo to use  

- https://food-img-classifier.herokuapp.com
- http://np-food-classifier.herokuapp.com
- can use this example link:  https://whatscookingamerica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ApplePie423.jpg

3.  maybe run model again?
- remove .ipynb files
- 

4.  We can take a video of mobile app in action and include a link to YouTube video.

---
Notes:  only Android users can run the mobile app.
