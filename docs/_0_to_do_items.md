# To Do

1.  clean up web app
This is a good example:  https://github.com/nikhilno1/healthy-or-not

app:
https://healthy-or-not.herokuapp.com

the form request example is here:
https://github.com/nikhilno1/healthy-or-not/blob/master/food-detector.py

Also, need to format output, or at least change to 2 decimal places.

2. figure out which repo to use  

- https://food-img-classifier.herokuapp.com
- http://np-food-classifier.herokuapp.com

3.  maybe run model again?
- remove .ipynb files
- 

4.  We can take a video of mobil app in action and include a link to YouTube video.
