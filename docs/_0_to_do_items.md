# To Do

## Clean up web app
  - Score should be 1 decimal point
  - Include softmax probability, with 1 decimal point
  - this is a good example of web app, in terms of presentation
    - the form request example is here: https://github.com/nikhilno1/healthy-or-not
    - app: https://healthy-or-not.herokuapp.com
  - on Heroku:  change "loss" to "output"✅

## Clean up **MOBILE** app
  - Output score should be 1 decimal point ✅
  - Include probability of outputs, with 2 decimal point ✅
  - formatting ✅
  - remove ".ipynb_checkpoints" as a category on the mobile screen 
- Rename repo:  (food-classifier to ----> mobile-deep-learning-classifier) ✅
  - contains Expo source code

## Heroku
- Rename deployed heroku url (np-food-classifier to ----> food-img-classifier) ✅
  - Heroku login: https://id.heroku.com/login
  - Heroku dashboard:  https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/food-img-classifier
- This is a good example:  
  - [healthy or not app](https://healthy-or-not.herokuapp.com)
  - code:  https://github.com/nikhilno1/healthy-or-not/blob/master/food-detector.py
## Run model again
- remove .ipynb checkpoint files

## Create video of mobile app
- take a video of mobile app in action and include a link to YouTube video.
