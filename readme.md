# Customizing
If you want to use this project as a template for your own model, here are the changes to be made.

Modify "title","host","description" in [conifg.js](confi.js).
Host should be a service that can listen to these type of requests.

/api/classify   Takes image data as binary and returns classes
/api/classes    Return a list of classes
